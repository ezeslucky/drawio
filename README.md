# 🎨 Drawio | Hand-drawn look & feel • Collaborative • Secure

---

**Drawio** is a web-based collaborative whiteboard where multiple users can draw, edit, and brainstorm together in real time. Whether solo or in a group session, the app offers a smooth, intuitive canvas experience with real-time sync, shape tools, editable text, and privacy-focused end-to-end encryption — all without needing an account.

### 🔐 **Privacy & End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)** in Drawio

Drawio is built with **privacy by design** to ensure that no sensitive drawing data can be accessed by anyone other than the intended participants.


### 🧠 **Key Never Touches the Server**

- The **encryption key** after the comma (`xyz456`) is part of the URL fragment (`#...`).
- This fragment is **never sent** in HTTP requests, meaning:
    
    > The server cannot see or store the encryption key.
    > 

### 🔒 **Client-Side Only Decryption**

- All encrypted drawing data is transmitted over WebSocket.
- The **decryption and rendering** happen completely on the client-side using the `key` from the URL.
- Even if someone intercepts the WebSocket traffic, they cannot decrypt the data without the key.

### 🛡️ **Benefits**

- No one — not even the server — can read what’s drawn in a room without the key.
- Ensures **confidentiality** for private brainstorming, teaching, or design sessions.
- Works like **Excalidraw's E2EE rooms**, but tailored for your collaborative drawing logic.

### 🧠 Reliability

- **Message Queue**: Stores unsent messages in memory/localStorage
- **Auto Retry**: Flushes queued messages on reconnect

---

### 🧭 Modes

- **Standalone Mode**: Offline/local drawing
- **Room Mode**: Collaborative sessions

---

### ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (Vite), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Canvas**: HTML Canvas API + Custom Engine
- **Realtime**: Native WebSocket (`useWebSocket` hook)
- **Security**: Hash-based E2EE
